Important:
    - Make highlight squares light up to indicate where piece can move
    - Make it so it determines whose turn it is in the game
    - Add functionality to the rest of the FEN stuff
Other:
    - When you drag a piece, it should be layered over everything. This doesn't work
      when a black piece goes over a white piece.
    - Make it so when you click the piece, anywhere else you click is valid
        - Probably construct another 8 * 8 array for rectangles that may or may not display this square
